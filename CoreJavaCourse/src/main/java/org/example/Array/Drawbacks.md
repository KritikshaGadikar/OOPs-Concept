## **Limitations and Drawbacks of Arrays**
1. **Fixed Size:** Once defined, the size of an array cannot be changed, leading to potential memory wastage or insufficient space.
2. **Homogeneous Data:** Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.
3. **Performance:** Inserting or deleting elements is costly as it requires shifting elements.
