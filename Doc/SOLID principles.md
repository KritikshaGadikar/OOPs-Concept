## The SOLID principles are five guidelines for writing clean, maintainable code:

- SRP: A class should have one responsibility.
- OCP: Software should be open to extension but closed to modification.
- LSP: Sub types must be replaceable with their base types.
- ISP: Clients should not depend on unnecessary interfaces.
- DIP: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on details.


- S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# Q.1: How are solid principles implemented in Java?
Ans: To implement SOLID principles in Java you need to understand basic OOP(object-oriented programming) concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation and then you can use these 5 SOLID principles in your Java code.

# Q.2: Are SOLID principles still relevant?
Ans: Yes, using SOLID principles is still relevant as using SOLID principles makes your code maintainable, testable, reusable, and scalable. It reduces the dependencies so that a block of code can be changed without affecting the other code blocks.

#  Q.3: How do you write SOLID code?
Ans: The key principle of writing SOLID code is using the single responsibility principle, open/closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, Interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle with the help of these principles you can write solid code.
