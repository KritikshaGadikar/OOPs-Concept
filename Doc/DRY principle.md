## The DRY Principle stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". It is a software development principle aimed at reducing repetition of code patterns.

### By following the DRY principle, you can:

- Improve maintainability: Changes only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of errors.
- Reduce redundancy: Avoids repetitive code, making the software more concise.
- Enhance reusability: Code can be reused across the system, leading to more modular and efficient software.

## In short, DRY encourages writing clean, efficient code that reduces duplication.
