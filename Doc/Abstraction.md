### Abstraction in Java

Abstraction is a way of hiding the complex details ( how something works) and only showing the essential parts. 
It helps focus on what an object does, not how it does.

#### In short:
- **Hiding complexity**: Only the important parts are visible, and the rest is hidden.

#### Benefits of Abstraction:
- **Makes code simpler**: You donâ€™t have to deal with unnecessary details.
- **Improves flexibility**: It helps design programs that are easier to modify or extend.

### abstraction in Java can be implemented in two ways:

- **Abstract Classes**: This is not pure abstraction , here we use extend (Abstraction1)
- **Interfaces** This is pure. and interface don't have constructor, and here we use implement (Abstraction2) 
        - (as discuss multiple inheritance can only be implemented with the help of interface) (Abstraction3)

### in my words:  / here we have the keyword abstract okay , so here now it is just the abstraction , it just exits but not a real thing , (shortly we can create it , we can think it but not use it)

### It is just a concept
