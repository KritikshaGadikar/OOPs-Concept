### Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation in Java is an object-oriented programming concept that refers to bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) 
that operate on the data into a single unit, called a **class**.
It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components,
which is done by using access modifiers (such as `private`, `protected`, or `public`).

#### In short:
- **Hiding data**: Making fields `private` to prevent direct access.
- **Providing controlled access**: Using **getter** and **setter** methods to allow controlled access to the private fields.

#### Benefits of Encapsulation:
- **Security**: Protects an object's internal state.
- **Flexibility**: Allows the internal implementation to be changed without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Maintainability**: Makes the code more modular and easier to manage.
