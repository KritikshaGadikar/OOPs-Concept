# Packages in Java 

In Java, **packages** are a mechanism to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. They help in organizing code, avoiding name conflicts, and controlling access.

## Key Points

### Definition
A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

### Purpose
- Prevent name conflicts.
- Provide access control.
- Organize classes logically for better maintainability.

### Types
1. **Built-in Packages**: Predefined packages like `java.util`, `java.io`, etc.
2. **User-defined Packages**: Custom packages created by developers.
